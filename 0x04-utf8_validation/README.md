# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation
This directory contains a solition for a question of how to a check a given list of integer are valid utf-8 character or not.

## Resources
Read or watch:

- [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
- [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4)

## Tasks
Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

- Prototype: `def validUTF8(data)`
- Return:` True if data is a valid UTF-8 - encoding, else return False`
- A character in UTF-8 can be `1 to 4 bytes `long
- The data set can contain multiple characters
- The data will be represented by a list of integers
- Each integer represents 1 byte of data, therefore you only need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer
